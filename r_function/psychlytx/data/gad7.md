**Information About the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7)**

## What it Measures:
* The symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Psychological Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).
* Symptoms assessed include subjective anxiety, worry, difficulty relaxing, restlessness,
irritability and fear of negative outcomes.

## What Higher Scores Mean:
* More severe generalized anxiety symptoms during the previous 2 weeks.
* Greater likelihood of meeting criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder or another anxiety
disorder (e.g. Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder).
* Optimal cut-off scores will vary across settings and populations. As general guidelines, authors
recommended that a cut-off score of **10** (Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams & Löwe, 2010) or **8**
(Plummer, Manea, Trepel & McMillan, 2015) be employed to identify the presence of any
anxiety disorder. They suggest that clinicians undertake a thorough diagnostic evalutation for
anxiety disorders when an individual's responses fall above the recommended cut-off score.

## Scale Quality:
* The GAD-7 has well-established psychometric properties and is among the most common
screening instruments used to assess generalized anxiety (for systematic reviews, see Kroenke,
Spitzer, Williams & Löwe, 2010; Plummer, Manea, Trepel & McMillan, 2015; van Ballegooijen,
Riper, Cuijpers, Oppen & Smit, 2016).

##Scale Structure:
* 7 items.
* 4-point Likert scale.
* Respondents indicate how frequently (0 = "Not at all"; 3 = "Nearly every day") they have been
bothered by the problems listed in each item (e.g. "Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge").
