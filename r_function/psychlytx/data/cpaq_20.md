**Information About The Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire - 20 (CPAQ-20)**

## What it Measures:
* Acceptance of pain. Pain acceptance is theorised to reduce unhelpful attempts aimed at avoiding or controlling pain sensations, and therefore focusing on the pursuit of valued activities and meaningful goals.
* The Activity Engagement subscale measures participation in life activities despite pain.
* The Pain Willingness subscale measures the extent to which pain is allowed in experience, without efforts to avoid or control it. 


## What Higher Scores Mean:
* Greater avoidance of life activities due to pain and/or greater struggle (psychologically and behaviourally) with the physiological experience of pain. 


## Scale Quality:
* The CPAQ has been used in a large number of studies examining the importance of pain acceptance. A systematic review concluded that the CPAQ was the optimal measure for assessing pain acceptance, despite some psychometric limitations (Reneman, Dijkstra, Geertzen & Dijkstra, 2010). 

##Scale Structure:
* The original version of the CPAQ contains 20 items (CPAQ-20). A shorter version contains 8 items (CPAQ-8). The two versions appear to have similar psychometric properties (Rovner, Vowles, Gerdle & Gillanders, 2015). 
* 7-point Likert scale. 
* Respondents indicate how true (0 = "Never true"; 6 = "Always true") each statement is for them (e.g. "I need to concentrate on getting rid of my pain"). 
* Factor analyses have supported a 2-factor structure (Baranoff, Hanrahan, Kapur & Connor, 2012; Lieu, Wan, Wei, Wang, Xu et al., 2016; Vowles, McCracken, McLeod & Eccleston, 2008).
