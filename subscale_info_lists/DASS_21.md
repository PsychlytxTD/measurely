**Information about the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales - 21 (DASS-21)**

## What it Measures:
* Severity of depression, anxiety and stress. The DASS-21 is **not a diagnostic instrument** and is based on a dimensional rather than categorical understanding of psychological disorder. 
Information below about DASS-21 subscales is derived from a summary provided by the University of New South Wales (http://www2.psy.unsw.edu.au/Groups/Dass/over.htm). 
* The Depression subscale assesses dysphoric mood, feelings of hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/participation, anhedonia, and inertia. 
* The Anxiety scale assesses autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle changes, situational anxiety, and the subjective experience of anxious affect.
* The Stress scale is sensitive to levels of chronic non-specific arousal. It assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily upset/agitated, irritable/over-reactive and impatient.

## What Higher Scores Mean:
* More severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress.

## Scale Quality:
* The DASS-21 has undergone extensive psychometric validation and is one of the most frequently adopted measures within clinical psychology. It is suitable for use with a wide range of populations (Henry & Crawford, 2005).

##Scale Structure:
* 21-item scale. 
* Three subscales (depression, anxiety & stress), each containing 7 items. Item scores on each subscale are summed.
* A general psychological distress score can be obtained by summing total scores across all subscales. 
* Respondents indicate on a 4-point Likert scale how often (0 = "never"; 3 = "almost always") each statement applied to them during the past week (e.g. "I found it hard to wind down"). 
* Factor analytic research has generally supported a 3-factor structure (Norton, 2007; Page, Hooke & Morisson, 2007), although alternative structural models have also been proposed (Osman, Wong, Bagge, Freedenthal, Gutierrez & Lozano, 2012).
