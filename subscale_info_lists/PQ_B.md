**Information about the Prodromal Questionnaire - Brief (PQ-B)**

## What it Measures:
* Attenuated positive symptoms, indicating risk for psychosis (also known as Psychosis-Like Experiences; PLEs) 
* Distress and impairment associated with Psychosis-Like Experiences.
* The PQ-B was developed to identify young people at ultra high risk (UHR) for a psychotic disorder. 
* The PQ-B **does NOT** diagnose a psychosis prodrome. It is intended to be followed by an interview-based assessment with a trained clinician. 

## What Higher Scores Mean:
* Higher scores on the total scale indicate that the individual is experiencing a wider range of attenuated positive symptoms. 
* Higher scores on the distress subscale indicate that the individual is more distressed/impaired as a result of attenuated positive symptoms.
* Higher scores on the total scale and distress subscale suggest **increased risk for developing a psychotic disorder.** However, it is important to note that among the general population, psychotic-like experiences can be present in up to 20 percent of adults, frequently in the absence of a full psychotic disorder (Hanssen et al., 2003). Importantly, individuals who are more distressed by psychotic-like experiences appear at greater risk for the development of a psychotic disorder.

## Scale Quality:
* Psychometric research supports the PQ-B, which is widely used, as a reliable tool for identifying adolescents at risk for psychosis (Fonseca-Pedrero, Gooding, Ortuno-Sierra & Paino, 2016). 

##Scale Structure:
* Contains 21 items. Each item is paired with a distress item. 
* Total scale items are presented in Yes/No format. Distress items are presented on a 5-point Likert scale.
* Respondents answer "yes" or "no" as to whether they experience a psychotic-like experience (e.g. "Do you feel that other people are watching you or talking about you?"). 
* If a "yes" answer is provided, respondents must indicate how much they find the experience frightening or problematic (1 = "strongly disagree"; 5 = "strongly agree"). 
* Yes/No scores and distress scores are summed to form a total scale and distress subscale respectively.
