**Information About the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS)**

## What it Measures:
* Degree of drug dependence in the past month. Longer timeframes for drug dependence (e.g. 12 months or 3 months) have also been employed clinically and for research purposes.

## What Higher Scores Mean:
* More severe drug dependence.
* The SDS is **not** a diagnostic instrument.
* Researchers have recommended cut-off scores for different types of substance use. If a patient scores on or above the recommended cut-off score, he or she is more likely to meet critera for a substance use disorder. 

## Scale Quality:
* The SDS is one of the most widely-employed and well-researched instruments for assessing severity of substance use (for a review see Piontek, Kraus & Klempova, 2008).

##Scale Structure:
* Contains 5 items. 
* 4-point Likert scale.
* Respondents are asked about the controllability of their use and associated worry. Questions are based on frequency (e.g. "a little") and difficulty (e.g."quite difficult"). 
* Items have been shown to load on a single factor (Gossop, Darke, Griffiths, Hando, Powis et al., 1995).
