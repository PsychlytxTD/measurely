**Information About the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7)**

## What it Measures:
* The perceived severity of insomnia symptoms as well as the extent to which those symptoms cause distress and daytime impairment.
* Scale content aligns in part with DSM-IV criteria for insomnia. 

## What Higher Scores Mean:
* Insomnia symptoms that are more severe, distressing and resultant in daytime impairment. 
* A score of **15** is recommended to indicate the likely presence of clinical insomnia (with moderate severity). However, a more recent study conducted by the original scale developer recommended a cut-off score of **10** for detecting insomnia cases in a large community sample (Morin, Belleville, Bélanger & Ivers, 2011). 

## Scale Quality:
* The ISI was reviewed as being "essential" for use in treatment efficacy and effectiveness studies (Buyusse, Ancoli-Israel, Edinger, Lichstein & Morin, 2005).

##Scale Structure:
* 7 items 
* 5-point Likert scale
* Respondents rate the severity of problems with falling asleep, staying asleep and waking up too early (i.e. 0 = "none", 4 = "very"). For the remaining questions, respndents answer questions about how much each statement applies to them (e.g. "How satisfied/dissatisfied are you with your current sleeping pattern?; 0 = "very satisfied"; 4 = "very dissatisfied"). 
* There has been limited research examining the factor structure of the ISI. Studies have supported a single factor structure (Sierra, Guillén-Serrano & Santos-Iglesias, 2008), a single-factor structure with reduced items (Dragioti, Wiklund, Alföldi & Gerdle, 2015), and a 3-factor structure (Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2012).
