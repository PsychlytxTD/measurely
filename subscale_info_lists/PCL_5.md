**Information About The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)**

## What it Measures:
* The 20 symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, as outlined in the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Psychological Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5).
* Re-experiencing symptoms, such as involuntary distressing dreams, memories, thoughts and feelings related to a traumatic event(s).
* Avoidance symptoms, such as efforts to avoid internal or external reminders of the traumatic event(s)
* Negative alterations in cognitions and mood, such as negative mood states, lack of positive emotions, and exaggerated negative beliefs about onself, the world, and others. 
* Hyperarousal symptoms, such as hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, sleep difficulties, irritability and concentration problems.

## What Higher Scores Mean:
* More severe PTSD symptomatology. 
* A provisional diagnosis of PTSD may be made if scores are sufficiently elevated. The optimal cut-off score will vary according to the service and population. As a general guideline, cut-off scores of **38** (Weathers et al., 2013) and **33** (Bovin et al., 2015) have been endorsed as sufficient for a provisional PTSD diagnosis. 

## Scale Quality:
* The PCL-5 has undergone extensive psychometric validation, and is one of the most widely used self-report screening measures for PTSD (for a review see McDonald & Calhoun, 2010). 

##Scale Structure:
* 20 items.
* 5-point Likert Scale. 
* Respondents are asked to what extent (0 = "Not at all"; 4 = "Extremely") they have been bothered by each symptom during the past month (e.g. "Repeated, disturbing and unwanted memories of the stressful experience").
* Although the recommended PCL-5 method of scoring is based on a 4-factor structure (consistent with DSM-5 criteria), studies have consistently shown that a 6- or 7-factor solution provides a better fit to the data (Armour, Contractor, Shea, Elhai & Pietrzak, 2016; Ashbaugh, Houle-Johnson, Herbert, El-Hage & Brunet, 2016; Blevins, Weathers, Davis, Witte & Domino, 2015; Bovin et al., 2015; Clark et al., 2016, Seligowski & Orcutt, 2015).
