**Information About the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R)**

## What it Measures:
* Emotional, cognitive and behavioural symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The seven symptom-categories of the scale are described below (subscale names appear bold in parentheses).
* Concerns about contamination and self-cleaning compulsions **(Washing)**. 
* Compulsions involving checking, such as verifying that electical devices have been turned off **(Checking)**,
* Distress about objects being improperly arranged **(Ordering)**.
* Difficulty with intrusive, negative thoughts **(Obsessing)**. 
* Hoarding behaviours **(Hoarding)**. 
* Attaching significance to certain numbers or feeling compelled to use numeric repetition/counting to alleviate fears/anxiety during activities **(Neutralizing)**. 

##What Higher Scores Mean:
* More severe OCD symptomatology. 
* An elevated total score may occur because the patient has scored highly within a single symptom-category (e.g. washing). Thus, a higher total score **does not** necessarily indicate the presence of OCD symptoms across multiple symptom-categories. 
* An elevated total score **does not** necessarily imply high levels of functional impairment. 
* The scale's developers have recommended a cut-off score of **21** to indicate the likely presence of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. 
* A cut-off score of **7** on the Hoarding subscale has been advocated to indicate the likely presence of Hoarding Disorder (Wooton et al., 2015). 

## Scale Quality:
* Reviews comparing self-report measures for OCD have strongly endorsed the use of the OCI-R as a screening and treatment-monitoring instrument (see Rapp, Bergman, Piacentini & McGuire, 2016; Storch, Benito & Goodman, 2011). 
* The OCI-R has performed well in several psychometric validation studies (Huppert et al., 2007; Wooton et al., 2015). 

##Scale Structure:
* Contains 18 items spread across 7 subscales.
* 5-point Likert scale.
* Respondents rate how much they have been bothered or distressed by each symptom during the past month (0 = "Not at all"; 4 = "Extremely"). 
* Psychometric evaluations have suggested that the OCI-R displays a 6-factor structure, corresponding to the 6 subscales listed above (Foa et al., 2002; Huppert et al., 2007).
