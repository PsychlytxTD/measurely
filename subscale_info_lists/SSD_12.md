* Greater likelihood of meeting criteria for Somatic Symptom Disorder.

* At least four investigations, including a large-scale population study, suggest that the SSD-12 has strong psychometric properties 
(Barsky, 2015; Toussaint, L?we, Br?hler & Jordan, 2017; Toussaint, Murray, Voigt, Herzog, Gierk, Kroenke, Rief, Henningsen & L?we, 2016;
Toussaint, Riedl, Kehrer, Schneider, L?wer & Linde, 2017).
