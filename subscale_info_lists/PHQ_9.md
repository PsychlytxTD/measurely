**Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9)**

## What it Measures:
* Symptoms of Depression over the previous 2 weeks.
* Symptoms of Depression are based on the 9 criteria for depressive disorders outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychological Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV).
* Symptoms assessed include anhedonia, low mood, sleep difficulties, appetite change, self-deprecating thoughts, concentration problems, changes in psychomotor speed, and thoughts of death/self-harm.
* An additional tenth item assesses the degree to which depressive symptoms have resulted in functional impairment. 

## What Higher Scores Mean:
* More severe depressive symptomatology over the previous 2 weeks.
* Greater likelihood of meeting criteria for Major Depressive Disorder.  
* A cut-off score of **10** has been used to make a provisional diagnosis of depression across different settings (for meta analyses, see Mitchell, Yadegarfar, Gill & Stubbs, 2016; Moriarty, Gilbody, McMillan & Manea, 2015).

## Scale Quality:
* The PHQ-9 is the most commonly-used screening measure for depression in primary care and has well-established psychometric properties (Moriarty, Gilbody, McMillan & Manea, 2015). 

##Scale Structure:
* 9 items.
* 4-point Likert scale.
* Respondents indicate how frequently (0 = "Not at all"; 3 = "Nearly every day") they have been bothered by the problems listed in each item (e.g. "Little interest or pleasure in doing things").
