**Information About the Geriatric Depression Scale - 15 (GDS-15)**

## What it Measures:
* Severity of depression over the past week.
* The GDS-15 is **not a diagnostic instrument** and **does not assess risk of suicide**. 

## What Higher Scores Mean:
* More severe depression.
* Research has indicated that scores of **5 or 6 indicate the presence of depression** (Mitchell Bird, Rizzo & Meader, 2010; Pocklington, Gilbody, Manea & McMillan, 2016; Sheik & Yesavage, 1986). 

## Scale Quality:
* The GDS-15 has received extensive support as the pre-eminent tool for screening depression among older individuals (for a systematic review and meta-analysis, see Pocklington, Gilbody, Manea & McMillan, 2016; Mitchell Bird, Rizzo & Meader, 2010). 

##Scale Structure:
* 15 items. 
* Yes-No format.
* Respondents are asked to indicate the best answer for them over the past week (e.g. "Are you basically satisfied with your life?"), by answering "YES" or "NO". Depending on the item, a score of 1 or 0 is registered. Item scores are then summed to yield a total score.  
* Studies examining the factor structure of the GDS-15 have yielded conflicting results, when treating data as continuous. However, a unidimensional factor structure has been  supported when treating data as categorical, in accordance with the yes-no format of the scale (Launeanu & Hubley, 2012).
