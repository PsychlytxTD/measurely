**Information About the Social Phobia Scale (SPS)**

## What it Measures:
* Anxiety about being scrutinised by others.
* Performance concerns such as blushing, appearing panicky and behaving oddly.
* Subjetively-felt self-consciousness while in different situations (e.g. using public toilets or riding
in an elevator). 
* **Does not** assess avoidance behaviours.

## What Higher Scores Mean:
* Greater fear of scrutiny by others and self-consciousness in social situations.
* Greater anxiety about performance during observation by others (particularly concerns about experiencing unwanted changes in bodily appearance or behaviour). 
* Higher likelihood of meeting criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder. But note that the SPS is **not** a diagnostic instrument.
* Some authors have argued that the SPS should not be used to measure a subtype of social anxiety (i.e. public scrutiny concerns; Gomez & Watson, 2017). Rather, they argue that the SPS should be administered alongside the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), with the combined scores on both scales being used to assess the level of social anxiety in a general sense.

## Scale Quality:
* In a systematic review of social anxiety self-report measures, the SPS was one of two scales to receive the highest number of positive ratings (Modini, Abbot & Hunt, 2015). 

##Scale Structure:
* Contains 20 items.
* 5-Point Likert scale.
* Respondents rate to what extent (0 = "Not at all"; 4 = "Extremely") each item is characteristic of them (e.g. "I fear I may blush when I am with others").
* Items have been shown to load on a single factor (Mortberg et al., 2017) and also on a general factor (when items are combined with those of the SIAS; Gomez & Watson, 2017).
